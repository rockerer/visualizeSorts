# visualizeSorts
Visualize Sorting algorithms using Javascript

## Visualization
After choosing a sorting algorithm and clicking start the sorting will
be shown in a canvas. Some important elements will be visually promoted
during the process.

## Sorting algorithms
I will start with the typical sorting algorithms and maybe lateron implement
some more exotic ones

- Bubblesort 
- Insertionsort
- Quicksort

## To be done

### Visualization
everything?

### Sorting algorithms
- Bogosort
- Radix-Sort
